**Problem:** Standard security audits often require complex, manual setups to ensure scans are anonymous, making them slow and difficult to automate in a modern development pipeline.

**Solution:** I engineered Dark Scan, a zero-configuration scanner that automatically routes all activity through the Tor network. This provides robust anonymity out of the box.

**Result:** The tool enables businesses to easily and safely integrate anonymized security scanning into their automated workflows, improving security posture without sacrificing speed or simplicity.
