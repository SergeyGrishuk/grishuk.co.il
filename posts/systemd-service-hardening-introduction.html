            <h2>Systemd Service Hardening - Introduction</h2>
            <hr />

            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>Systemd provides a set of settings that can be applied to a service to harden it. 
                Those settings allow controlling privileges, networking, file system access and more. 
                For example, a service can be “chrooted” into a directory and not be able to access any of the file system files, 
                or it can be isolated from the network completely. To make the process of the hardening easier, 
                systemd comes with a built-in command that allows to check and score the security level of each service on the system, 
                which is helpful in the process of the hardening.</p>

            <h3>Service Security Analysis</h3>

            <p>As mentioned previously, systemd has a built-in command for service analysis. 
                The command is <code>systemd-analyze security</code> which lists all the existing services and their score. 
                Below is an example taken from Ubuntu 24.</p>

            <img alt="systemd analyze security output" class="post-image" src="/images/systemd-analyze-security-output.PNG">

            <p>The same command followed by the name of the service provides an in depth look into its security configurations. 
                For example, the <code>systemd-analyze security ssh</code> 
                command shows the security settings of the ssh service.</p> 
                <p><i>On RHEL based distributions the service is named <code>sshd</code>.</i></p>

            <img alt="systemd analyze security ssh output" class="post-image" src="/images/systemd-analyze-security-ssh.PNG">

            <p>The output provides the names of the settings (same as it is written in the .service file), 
                a short description for each one of them and the exposure score. 
                When dealing with service hardening it is important to keep in mind the actual purpose of the service, 
                maybe it needs access to the file system, or it requires root privileges and so on. 
                Restricting all of the available settings will probably result in an unusable service.</p>

            <h3>Applying Service Hardening</h3>
            <p>To apply any of the available settings, 
                open the service file via a text editor and add the needed configuration under the <code>[Service]</code> section. 
                Once the settings are written, 
                run the <code>systemctl daemon-reload</code> command followed by a <code>systemctl restart SERVICE_NAME</code> command.</p>

            <p>The location of the service file can be found by running the <code>systemctl status SERVICE_NAME</code> command. 
                For example, the SSH service file on Ubuntu is located under <code>/usr/lib/systemd/system/</code> as seen in the output.</p>
